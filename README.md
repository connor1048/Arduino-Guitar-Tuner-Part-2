# Arduino-Guitar-Tuner-Part-2
optimized version of my Arduino guitar tuner
The goal of this program is to tune a guitar. 
               This code is to be paired with the schemtaic that can be found on my website: 
               This code takes an input signal from am electric or acoustic guitar string via the arduino sound sensor and processes the 
               the frequency via foureir analysis to determine the frequency of the signal (guitar string). Once the frequency of the signal from the guitar string is determined, 
               the LEDs will direct whether to tune the guitar string up or down to acheive accurate standard tuning for the guitar.
